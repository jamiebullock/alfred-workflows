## Create Empty File

This workflow creates a new file in the folder currently selected in Finder. If this is not possible, the file is created on the currently logged in user's Desktop.

The workflow can be activated by the ‘file’ keyword within Alfred followed by an optional argument specifying the name of the file to be created. If no argument is specified the filename ‘Untitled.txt’ will be used.

The workflow can also be activated by the keyboard shortcut Command-Control-F, in which case ‘Untitled.txt’ is always used as the filename.

The workflow can be activated by the ‘stopwatch’ keyword within Alfred.
